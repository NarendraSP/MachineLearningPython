Machine Learning is a latest __buzzword__ floating around. It desrves to, as it is one of the most interesting subfield of Computer Science.<br>
__What does Machine Learning really means?__<br>
Machine Learning is an application of artificial intelligence(AI) that provides systems the ability  to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.<br>
__Machine Learning focuses on the development of computer programs__ that can access data and use it to learn for themsleves.<br>
The process of learning begins with data, such as, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide. __The primary aim is to allow the computers learn automatically__ without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly.

- You are the CEO of restaurant Franchise and are considering different cities for opening new outlet.
- The chain already has trucks in various cities and you have data for profits and population from the cities.
- You would like to use this data to help you select which city to expand to next.
- The dataset contains in the data folder of this Project.

### [Probability of admission](./Classification-Logistic%20Reg)
![image.png](image/Chances-of-admission.png)
- You are the administrator of a university department and you want to determine each applicant's chance of admission based on their
results on two exams.
- You have historical data from previous applicants that you can use as a training set for logistic regression.
- For each training example, you have the applicant's scores on two exams and the admissions decision.

### [Accepting or Rejecting Microchips based on test results](./Classification-Logistic%20Reg)
![image.jpg](image/microchip-test.jpg)
- Suppose you are the product manager of the factory and you have the test results for some microchips on two different tests.
- From these two tests, you would like to determine whether the microchips should be accepted or rejected.
- To help you make the decision, you have a dataset of test results on past microchips, from which you can build a logistic regression model.

- On 2D Dataset, with different values of C and Sigma usign Gaussian Kernels.
- On Trained dataset using learning best parameters from the function and cross validation.
- Visualizing linear and non-linear decision boundaries by SVM Classification.
